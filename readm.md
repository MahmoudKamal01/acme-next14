## Description

This project provides a backend API for a question-answering system powered by Google AI's generative language model. Users can submit questions, receive answers generated by the AI model, and optionally store their questions and answers for future reference.

## Features

- **AI-powered question answering:** Leverages Google's Generative AI to provide comprehensive responses to user queries.
- **User authentication:** Implements JWT-based authentication for secure access to user-specific data.
- **Question storage (optional):** Users can choose to store their question-answer pairs for later retrieval.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A Google Cloud project with the Generative AI API enabled. You can follow Google's instructions for setting up Generative AI https://ai.google/(https://ai.google.dev/api/rest).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/faiz-mohammad-answersai-backend.git](https://github.com/your-username/faiz-mohammad-answersai-backend.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd faiz-mohammad-answersai-backend

3- Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i

Configuration
## 1. Environment Variables:

# Create a file named .env in your project's root directory. This file should contain the following environment variables (replace with your actual values):

   ```
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret_key
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://your_mongo_connection_string
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_api_key
   ```

# Important:

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: A secret key used for signing JWT tokens for user authentication. Choose a strong and unique key.
MONGO_URI: The connection string for your MongoDB database.
GEMINI_API_KEY: Your Google Cloud API key for accessing the Generative AI service.
Note: You can exclude the .env file from version control using tools like .gitignore.

## 2. MongoDB Database:

Set up a MongoDB database instance and configure the MONGO_URI environment variable accordingly.

Running the Application
Start the development server:

   ```
npm start   # or yarn start
 ```

Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will start the Node.js server and listen for incoming requests on the default port (usually 8000).

(Optional) Start a live-reloading server for development:

   ```
npm run server   # or yarn server
 ```

Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will use Nodemon to automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to your code.

API Usage
The API endpoints are documented below. You can use tools like Postman or curl to send requests to the server.

1. User Authentication:

# Endpoint: /api/users/ (POST)
   ```
JSON
{
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
}


# Endpoint: /api/users/login (POST)

Request Body:

   ```
   {
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password"
   }
   ```

Response:

JSON
{
    "token": "your_jwt_token"
}

Upon successful login, the server returns a JWT token that you'll need to include in subsequent requests that require authentication.

2. Submit a Question:

Endpoint: /api/questions (POST)

Request Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
Request Body:

JSON
{
    "question": "your_question"
}
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Response:

JSON
{
    "_id": "question_id",
    "user_id": "user_id",
    "content": "your_question",
    "answer": "ai_generated_answer",
    "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
Use code with caution.
